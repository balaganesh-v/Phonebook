# 📇 Phone Book — MERN Stack Project

This is a **Phone Book application** developed using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js).

The project focuses on implementing core MERN concepts by building a full-stack CRUD application where users can manage contact details efficiently, with support for **dark and light mode** for better user experience.

## 🌐 Live Application

- **Frontend (Vercel):**
  https://vbalaganesh-phonebook-version2.vercel.app/

- **Backend (Render):**
  https://phonebook-1uj9.onrender.com/

> **Note:**
> The backend is hosted on **Render**. Since it uses a free instance, it may take **up to 5 or 10 minutes** to respond initially if the server is inactive.
> The frontend is deployed on **Vercel** and loads instantly.

## ✨ Key Features

- Add new contacts
- View contact list
- Edit contact information
- Delete contacts
- Full CRUD operations
- **Dark and light mode support**
- API-based frontend–backend communication

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

This project helped me to:

- Connect React frontend with Express backend
- Work with **REST APIs**
- Handle database operations using **MongoDB**
- Implement **dark and light mode** for better UX
- Deploy backend on **Render** and frontend on **Vercel**

This project was very useful for strengthening my full-stack development skills.

## 📌 Conclusion

This Phone Book project helped me understand how a MERN stack application works from frontend to backend. I learned how to connect React with Node and Express, store data in MongoDB, perform basic CRUD operations, and implement **dark and light mode**.

It also gave me hands-on experience with deploying the backend on Render and the frontend on Vercel. Overall, this project was very useful for learning MERN concepts and building confidence in full-stack development.
